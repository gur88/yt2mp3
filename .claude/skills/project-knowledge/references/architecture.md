# Architecture

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+, Flask — chosen for a minimal single-file server, no build step needed for a local tool
- **Extraction**: `yt-dlp` — downloads best available audio-only stream, never touches video
- **Conversion**: system `ffmpeg` binary, invoked via `subprocess`, parsed with `-progress pipe:1` for live percentage — chosen over yt-dlp's built-in postprocessors specifically to get granular conversion progress
- **Frontend**: static `index.html` served by Flask (`static/`), no framework

## Project Structure

├── downloads/          # scratch dir for in-flight jobs; files deleted after serving

## Key Dependencies

- `yt-dlp` — audio extraction
- `flask` — HTTP server
- `ffmpeg` — external system binary, must be on PATH (not a pip dependency)

## Data Flow

1. `POST /api/download` with `{url, format, quality}` → creates a `job_id`, spawns a background thread, returns immediately
2. Background thread: yt-dlp downloads best audio stream (progress hook updates `jobs[job_id]` 0→90%), then `ffmpeg` re-encodes/remuxes to the target format (progress parsed from ffmpeg's own `-progress` output, mapped 90→100%)
3. Client polls `GET /api/status/<job_id>` for `{status, stage, percent, filename, error}`
4. When `status == "done"`, client fetches `GET /api/file/<job_id>` — file is streamed as an attachment; job entry is removed from memory immediately, and file deletion is handed off to a background thread (`_cleanup_file`) that retries with backoff (up to 5 attempts, 0.5s apart) before giving up and logging a warning
5. The frontend stops polling `/api/status` as soon as the job reaches `done`/`error`, or the user clicks the download button — guarded by a `pollStopped` flag checked before acting on any response, so a slow in-flight request can't act on a job that's already gone (this was previously a source of stray 404s)

**Windows note:** `send_file()` can still hold the OS file handle open for a moment after the response is generated, so an immediate `unlink()` right after `send_file` returns a `PermissionError` on Windows. This is why deletion retries in the background rather than deleting inline in `after_this_request`.

## Format Handling

| Format | Container ext | Codec strategy |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| mp3    | `.mp3`        | always re-encode with `libmp3lame` at requested bitrate |
| aac    | `.m4a`        | stream-copy if source is already `.m4a`/`.mp4`, else re-encode with `aac` @192k |
| opus   | `.opus`       | stream-copy if source is `.webm`/`.opus`, else re-encode with `libopus` @160k |

## Data Model

None — no database. State is an in-memory `jobs: dict[str, dict]` in `app.py`, lost on process restart.
